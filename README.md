# private-eks-cluster

CloudFormation template and associated shell script to create a VPC, an EKS cluster, and a worker node group all without internet connectivity.

## Overview

This collection of CloudFormation templates and Bash shell scripts will deploy an EKS cluster into a VPC with no IGW or NAT Gateway attached.
To do this it will create a VPC which has VPC endpoints configured for EC2 and ECR.  It will also create a VPC endpoint to a web proxy that you
expose via an Endpoint service.  **Note**: this is not required for a private EKS cluster but its assumed you'll want to pull containers from
Docker Hub, GCR.io, etc so the proxy server is configured.

With the VPC environment and permissions prepared the shell script will provision an EKS cluster with logging enabled and no public endpoint.

Next it will deploy an autoscaling group into the VPC to connect to the EKS cluster.  Once completed you can (from within the VPC) communicate
with your EKS cluster and see a list of running worker nodes.

## Getting started

You should only need to edit the variable definitions found in `variables.sh`.  The variables are:
 - CLUSTER_NAME, the desired name of the EKS cluster
 - REGION, the AWS region in which you want resources created
 - HTTP_PROXY_ENDPOINT_SERVICE_NAME, this is the name of a VPC endpoint service you created which represents an HTTP proxy
 - KEY_PAIR, the name of an EC2 key pair to be used as an SSH key on the worker nodes
 - VERSION, the EKS version you wish to create ('1.13', '1.12', or '1.11')
 - AMI_ID, the region-specific AWS EKS worker AMI to use.  See below for a link to the AWS documentation listing all managed AMIs.
 - INSTANCE_TYPE, the instance type to be used for the worker nodes
 - S3_STAGING_LOCATION, an S3 bucket name and optional prefix to which CloudFormation templates and a kubectl binary will be uploaded

 Once these values are set you can execute `launch_all.sh` and get a coffee.  This will take approximately 10 min to create the environment,
 cluster, and worker nodes.

 Once its completed you will have an EKS cluster that you can review using the AWS console or CLI.  You can also remotely access your VPC using
 Amazon WorkSpaces, VPN, or similar means.  Using the `kubectl` client you should then see something similar to:

 ```bash
 [ec2-user@ip-10-10-40-207 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                          STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
ip-10-0-2-186.eu-central-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   45m   v1.13.8-eks-cd3eb0
ip-10-0-4-219.eu-central-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   45m   v1.13.8-eks-cd3eb0
ip-10-0-8-46.eu-central-1.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   45m   v1.13.8-eks-cd3eb0
[ec2-user@ip-10-10-40-207 ~]$ kubectl get ds -n kube-system
NAME         DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
aws-node     3         3         3       3            3           <none>          52m
kube-proxy   3         3         3       3            3           <none>          52m
```

There you go - you now have an EKS cluster in a private VPC!

## Under the covers
Amazon EKS is managed upstream K8s. So all the requirements and capabilities of Kubernetes apply. This is to say that when you create an EKS
cluster you are given either a private or public (or both) K8s master mode, managed for you as a service. When you create EC2 instances,
hopefully as part of an auto scaling group, those nodes will need to be able to authenticate into the K8s master node and begun becoming
managed by the master. The node runs the standard Kubelet and Docker daemon and will need the master's name and CA certificate. To do thus
the Kubelet will query the EKS service or you can provide these as arguments to the bootstrap.sh. After connecting to the master it will
receive instruction to launch daemon sets. To do this Kubelet and Docker will need to authenticate themselves into ECR wherethe DS images are
probably kept. Please note that the 1.13 version of Kubelet is compatible with VPC endpoints for ECR but 1.11 and 1.12 will require a proxy
server to reach ecr.REGION.amazonaws.com.  After pulling down the daemon sets your cluster should be stable and ready for use. For details
about configuring proxy servers for Kubelet etc please check out the source code.

## Development notes
### configure proxy for docker daemon

### authenticate with ECR
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth

aws ecr get-login --region eu-west-1 --no-include-email
602401143452.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/amazon-k8s-cni:v1.5.0
602401143452.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eks/kube-proxy:v1.11.5
602401143452.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/eks/coredns:v1.1.3

Docker unable to authenitcate with ECR, couldn't get docker credential helper to work

Setting aws-node to pull image only if image is not present found success

### Procedure

1. Create a VPC with only private subnets
1. Create VPC endpoints for dkr.ecr, ecr, ec2, s3
1. Provide a web proxy for the EKS service API
1. Create an EKS cluster in the private VPC
1. Edit the aws-node daemonset to only pull images if not present
```bash
kubectl edit ds/aws-node -n kube-system
```
1. Deploy the CFN template, specifying proxy url and security group granting access to VPC endpoints
1. Add the worker instance role to the authentiation config map for the cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f aws-auth-cm.yaml
```
